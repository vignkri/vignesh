Sustainable Energy Engineer who graduated from the Technical University of Denmark, DTU in the summer of 2015. Currently, I am employed at Leapcraft creating data products in the field of smart cities and in my free time work with new energy technologies. All of the views presented in this blog are mine and not of my employer. 

In my free time, I tinker with programming, read a lot, watch a lot of movies/tv-shows and write about a variety of things that I currently am interested in. This is an extension of all of those things I do. Besides all of the things done with a roof over my head, I love running and cycling which takes up some interesting amount of time in my life.
