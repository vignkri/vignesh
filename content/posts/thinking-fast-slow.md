I've been reading this book for the last one year (each chapter multiple times). As the cover suggests, reading this book slow is very important. There is a decade's worth of research into human psychology and psyche condensed into the pages of this book. The fact that human thought process is explained and deconstructed through well thought out experiments and this deconstruction remains valid across repetitive tests is a crucial thought process to how similar we are. The insights into how brains are wired and the logical shortcomings that hide within plain sight is also an interesting view. This is definitely a great book to read. Highly recommended!
